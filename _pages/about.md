I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student from the [School of Information Science and Engineering](http://www.ischool.sdnu.edu.cn/), [Shandong Normal University](https://www.sdnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include **Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and VR.**

I was very fortunate to be advised by [Assoc. Prof. Li Shengtao](http://www.ischool.sdnu.edu.cn/info/1322/5803.htm) from the ACM Programming Contest Lab during my first and second years.

I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Lecturer Sui Xiaodan](http://www.ischool.sdnu.edu.cn/info/1323/7000.htm) in my third year.

I am now very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yiran Shen](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/shenyiran/zh_CN/index.htm) and am currently affiliated with the IGIP Laboratory at the School of Software, Shandong University.

You can find my CV here: [Yin bowen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/resume.pdf).
